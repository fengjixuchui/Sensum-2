## ***Development of Sensum stopped, I cant take care and maintain 2 cheats at once.***

## Sensum - Internal legit cheat
### Operation Riptide broke the cheat, list of bugs/problems so far:



- Aimbot was locking on backtrack records.
- Backtrack isnt working
- Both Autowall and Hitchance arent working, because trace.hitgroup is returning nonsense values.
- Glow drops ~50 fps (Not the cheat's issue, I would have to rebuild the glow completely to eliminate fps drops, its kinda Valve's problem.)

**Further optimizations:**<br>
This project is using the SSE2 instructions set by default.<br>
If your cpu supports AVX, AVX2 or AVX512 you can enable it in the project settings under:<br> **"C++ -> Code Generation"**, to gain more performance.

**Frequently Asked Questions:**
- > Where is the config location?
  -- C:\Sensum\configs    
- > Why do I have such bad fps drops?
    -- Make sure to compile the cheat in release x86
